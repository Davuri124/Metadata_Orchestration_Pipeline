AGENT DECISION JUSTIFICATION
---------------------------
The classical confidence agent computes its decision using a single deterministic formula based on the ratio of rejected to total records. This results in a linear confidence score and a fixed mapping to an execution profile.

The quantum-inspired agent differs by modeling data quality as a probabilistic composition of multiple states, such as valid and recoverable. Its confidence score is derived from the combined probability of acceptable states rather than a single rejection ratio.

Because of this probabilistic modeling, the quantum-inspired agent may produce a higher or lower confidence score for the same dataset, leading to a different execution profile selection.

The observed divergence does not indicate an error in either agent. Instead, it highlights differing interpretations of data quality, where the classical agent assumes binary validity and the quantum-inspired agent allows partial recoverability to influence execution behavior.
