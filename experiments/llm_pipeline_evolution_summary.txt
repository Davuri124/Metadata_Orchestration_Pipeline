PIPELINE EVOLUTION SUMMARY
--------------------------
The pipeline evolved through a sequence of clearly versioned metadata configurations. Each metadata version is uniquely linked to specific execution runs, ensuring reproducibility and traceability.

Change impact analysis shows that updates to metadata resulted in measurable yet controlled changes to output and rejection counts. No abrupt or unexplained behavioral shifts were observed across executions.

Data lineage confirms continuity across all runs, linking outputs to their source datasets, governing metadata versions, and execution timestamps.

Overall, the pipeline demonstrates an incremental, governed evolution where changes are observable, auditable, and constrained by deterministic governance mechanisms.
