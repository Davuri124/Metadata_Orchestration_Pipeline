GOVERNANCE EXPLANATION
---------------------
The pipeline demonstrates a high level of governance readiness.

All mandatory governance artifacts are present, including execution summaries, metadata versioning records, change impact analysis, and data lineage tracking.

Governance quality metrics indicate strong trace completeness, meaning decisions and execution outcomes are fully auditable.

While the system is governance-ready, maturity indicators suggest that further enhancements may improve long-term adaptability. However, no governance violations are observed.

Overall, this governance model is reliable because all decisions are observable, traceable, and reproducible.
