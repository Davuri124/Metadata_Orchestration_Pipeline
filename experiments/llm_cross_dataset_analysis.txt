CROSS-DATASET ANALYSIS
---------------------
The execution summaries indicate measurable behavioral differences between datasets. Some datasets exhibit higher rejection rates, leading to reduced output records, while others maintain higher acceptance ratios.

Agent confidence scores vary accordingly. Datasets with cleaner structural conformance tend to produce higher confidence, resulting in full or dry-run execution profiles. In contrast, datasets with greater inconsistency are more frequently associated with validation-only execution.

These differences do not indicate instability in the pipeline. Instead, they demonstrate dataset-sensitive behavior, where execution adapts based on observed quality characteristics while preserving governance constraints.

Overall, the system exhibits consistent decision logic applied across heterogeneous datasets, reinforcing that behavior is data-driven rather than hard-coded.
